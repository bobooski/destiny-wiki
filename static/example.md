Destiny 2 is a game of two halves. You’ve got a brilliant universe dripping with story, filled with some of the most exciting and innovative FPS multiplayer action you’ll ever see in a video game. On the other side you’ve got a game that can seem utterly impenetrable especially to newcomers and lapsed players.

This reputation for impenetrability has permeated the narrative surrounding the game, meaning many tempted into playing by the fantastic trailers and tales from their friends of adventures amongst the stars can bounce off the game. Given the amount that it shoves at new players, along with some notable gaps in the game’s story caused by the removal of some earlier content this reputation for inaccessibility can sometimes be justified.

But fear not, dear reader. We’ve compiled a beginner’s guide that should help you get up to speed with the game both mechanically and in terms of the game’s ongoing story. If you’ve ever wanted to play Destiny 2 but been put off by rumours of impenetrability or been overwhelmed starting the game, this is the guide for you.

It’s time to begin your journey into Destiny 2.

## Getting Started

Starting your Destiny 2 journey can seem daunting at first, but with a few things to bear in mind you’ll soon be hopping between planets and taking the fight to the enemies of humanity. Here’s what you need to know as you start a new life in the far future.

### Choosing a Class

First up is your class. There are three classes in Destiny 2: Titan, Warlock, and Hunter.

Titans are your brutes, standing wherever the fighting is thickest, shrugging off damage and engaging the enemy up close and personal. They tend to have shields that can protect teammates and have abilities that deal colossal damage to nearby foes.

Warlocks offer support to their fellow guardians, buffing damage or boosting healing whilst utilising elemental spells to lay down ranged damage. Think of them as warrior-scholars, using deadly magical arts to level the playing field.

Finally we have Hunters. Outlaws, scouts, and deadly assassins, Hunters focus on mobility and misdirection to dance through the battlefield leaving corpses in their wake. Able to dodge damage whilst dealing it, they are skilled both with the blade and ranged attacks.

Each of the classes offers a unique class fantasy, from stalwart Titans to fast-moving deadly Hunters. That said, all classes can use all weapons, so there’s nothing stopping you playing a Warlock who specialises in shotguns or a Titan who uses sniper rifles.

It’s their abilities which help determine their role on the battlefield, so feel free to try them out and find out what best suits your style of play. We’ll cover more about abilities further down this guide.
